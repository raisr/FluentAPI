# **FluentAPI**

**APIs made simple. Secure. Scalable.**  
Welcome to **FluentAPI** – my open-source project designed to help API providers focus on what really matters: their business logic. Security, authentication, billing, and monitoring? FluentAPI takes care of it.

## 🚀 What is FluentAPI?

APIs are the backbone of the modern web. But deploying secure, scalable APIs is often more complicated than it should be. With **FluentAPI**, I aim to create an infrastructure that simplifies this process.

### My Goal:
- Build a platform that removes technical hurdles for API providers.
- Create a system that is easy to set up, extend, and scale.
- Offer a solution that is fully **open-source** and containerized.

## 🌱 Current Status

FluentAPI is in its early stages. The foundation is currently being built, and there's still a lot to do. I'm working on establishing a solid base that can be easily extended in the future. If you're interested in contributing or providing feedback, you're more than welcome!

## 🔭 The Vision

With FluentAPI, I aim to develop a **modular, containerized API infrastructure** that offers:

- **🔐 Security & Authentication**  
  Integrated solutions like **Keycloak** for OAuth2/OpenID Connect.

- **📊 Monitoring & Logging**  
  Seamless integration with **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for clean and efficient monitoring.

- **⚙️ Easy API Routing**  
  Configure routes through an intuitive **web UI**, while a reverse proxy (e.g., **YARP**) handles the traffic under the hood.

- **💼 Billing & Usage Tracking**  
  Automated tracking and billing features for API users.

## 🔧 Technologies I’ll Be Using

- **ASP.NET Core** – for the core API logic.
- **YARP** – reverse proxy for flexible and secure routing.
- **Keycloak** – for authentication and access management.
- **Prometheus & Grafana** – for monitoring and visualization.
- **Docker** – for easy containerization and deployment.
